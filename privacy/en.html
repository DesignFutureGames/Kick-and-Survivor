    <p><strong>Company (Controller)</strong>: Design Future Games<br>
       <strong>Service covered</strong>: Mobile game <em>Kick and Survivor</em> and related features provided under the same title</p>

    <p>This document may be provided in multiple languages. In case of any discrepancy, the Korean version shall prevail.</p>

    <h2>1. Core Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We <strong>do not require any sign-up</strong> and do not ask for directly identifying personal data such as your real name, email address, or phone number.</li>
      <li>We <strong>do not operate our own backend servers</strong>. Game data is stored and processed on your device, in your Google Play account, and in systems operated by third-party providers such as Google.</li>
      <li>When you uninstall the app, game data stored on your device under our control is removed together with the app and we do not retain a copy.</li>
      <li>Third-party providers (e.g. Google) may independently store and process data according to their own policies and applicable law; their responsibility and policies apply to such processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Purposes and Categories of Data</h2>

    <h3>1) Purposes of processing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service delivery and operation</strong>: running the game, calculating scores and rankings, optional Google Play Games sign-in, managing in-game assets (such as coins).</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: serving banner, interstitial, and rewarded ads through Google AdMob, including frequency capping, performance measurement, and fraud prevention.</li>
      <li><strong>In-app purchases</strong>: verifying purchases of paid items (e.g. coins) and restoring them when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Error analysis</strong>: using minimal diagnostic and crash information to improve stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2) Categories of data processed</h3>
    <p>We do not independently collect or store data that directly identifies you. The following data is mainly collected and processed automatically by third-party SDKs such as Google AdMob and Google Play services, and we only access aggregated or limited information exposed through those services.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device and app information</strong>: advertising ID (AAID), OS and device model, app version, language and country setting, screen size, and similar technical data.</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate location</strong>: country/region inferred from IP address (for ad delivery and fraud prevention).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: game progress, scores and rankings, play time, button clicks, and basic usage logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Leaderboard data (optional)</strong>: if you sign in to Google Play Games, your player ID, nickname, profile image, and scores may be used for leaderboard features.<br>
        <small>Leaderboard data is handled within Google Play Games Services; we only access it to the extent necessary to display rankings.</small>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Purchase information</strong>: product identifier (SKU), purchase time, purchase token/receipt, and transaction status (including refund or cancellation).<br>
        <small>Actual payment instrument details (e.g. card numbers) are handled by Google Play Billing and are not accessible to us.</small>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostic data</strong>: crash logs and error codes within the scope provided by the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) How data is collected</h3>
    <p>The above data is mainly <strong>collected and processed automatically by third-party SDKs</strong> such as Google AdMob, Google Play Billing, and Google Play Games Services when you use the app. We typically receive only aggregated or limited information made available through their dashboards or APIs.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Processing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We rely on the following third-party services to deliver the game, and data is processed by them to the extent necessary for their functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob (Google LLC)</strong> – ad serving, frequency capping, performance measurement, detection of invalid traffic.</li>
      <li><strong>Google UMP (User Messaging Platform)</strong> – collecting and managing ad-related consent in regions such as the EEA and UK.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Billing (Google LLC)</strong> – approval and verification of in-app purchases, refunds.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Games Services (Google LLC)</strong> – optional sign-in and leaderboard features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Their own privacy policies govern the details of how they process and retain data. Within the limits allowed by law, we bear only limited responsibility for their independent processing activities and use their services under their published terms.</p>

    <h2>4. Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We <strong>do not keep user data on our own servers for long-term storage</strong>. Game settings and progress are mainly stored on your device or within the store/platform ecosystem.</li>
      <li>When you uninstall the app, game data stored locally on your device under our control is removed and cannot be restored by us through normal means.</li>
      <li>Records related to in-app purchases and advertising may be retained separately by Google or other third parties in accordance with their legal obligations and internal policies, which we do not directly control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Uninstalling the app</strong>: you can delete all locally stored game data under our control by uninstalling the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad consent and personalization</strong>: in some regions, you can manage ad-related consent on the initial UMP consent screen or via in-app settings, where available.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID</strong>: you can reset or limit personalized ads in your Android system settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Google account, Play Games, and purchase history</strong>: you can manage these through your Google account and the Google Play Store.</li>
      <li><strong>Requests to exercise rights</strong>: for data that we can access or control, you may contact us to request access, deletion, or restriction of processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Third-party services such as Google may process and store data on servers located in countries outside your own (for example, the United States). In such cases, those providers implement appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable law, and we use their services within the scope of our contracts and their public policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, including limiting access rights, using encrypted connections (HTTPS) where applicable, maintaining access logs, and protecting against malware.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This game is not primarily directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in a manner that violates applicable law, including children under 14 in Korea or under 13 under U.S. COPPA rules. If we become aware that such information has been collected without proper authorization, we will delete it or obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law and within the scope of data we can access, you may request access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, or withdrawal of consent by contacting us. Data stored by third-party providers such as Google must be handled through their own procedures and policies.</p>
