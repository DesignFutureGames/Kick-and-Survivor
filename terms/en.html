    <h2>Article 1 (Purpose)</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) set forth the conditions of use of the mobile game <em>Kick and Survivor</em> (the “Service”) provided by Design Future Games (the “Company”), and define the rights and obligations between the Company and users of the Service (“Users”).</p>

    <h2>Article 2 (Definitions)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“User” means any person who agrees to these Terms and uses the Service.</li>
      <li>“Linked Services” means third-party services and SDKs used in connection with the Service, such as Google Play Games, Google Play Billing, Google AdMob, and Google UMP.</li>
      <li>“Virtual Currency (Coins)” means electronic data provided within the Service, paid or free of charge, which is not redeemable for cash and can be used only within the Service.</li>
      <li>“Content” means all data related to the Service, including game data (scores, progress, rankings, etc.), text, images, audio, video and any other materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 3 (Effect and Amendment of the Terms)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>These Terms take effect when they are posted on the initial screen of the Service, in the settings menu, or otherwise notified to Users.</li>
      <li>The Company may amend these Terms to the extent that such amendment does not violate applicable laws. When the Company amends the Terms, it will specify the details and effective date of the amendment and give notice in the Service in a reasonable manner at least 7 days prior to the effective date (or 30 days in advance in the case of changes unfavorable to Users).</li>
      <li>If a User continues to use the Service after the amended Terms take effect, the User is deemed to have agreed to the amended Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 4 (User Eligibility and Accounts)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Service is primarily intended for general adult users and is not mainly directed at children.</li>
      <li>The Company does not operate its own membership accounts. Google Play Games sign-in is an optional linkage used for specific features such as leaderboards.</li>
      <li>Users are responsible for securely managing their devices, Google accounts, passwords and other access credentials, and are solely responsible for any damages arising from their failure to do so.</li>
      <li>If a minor makes a purchase without the consent of a legal guardian, whether such purchase may be cancelled or refunded is determined in accordance with applicable law and Google Play Store policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 5 (Scope of the Service)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The specific content of the Service, including game modes, item configurations and leaderboard operation methods, may be changed from time to time at the Company’s discretion.</li>

      <li>The Company may entrust the provision of all or part of the Service to another business operator or provide the Service in conjunction with third-party services.</li>

      <li>The Company grants Users a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service and Content for personal purposes only.</li>
      <li>Users shall not:
        <ul>
          <li>reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise analyze the game client or server (if any);</li>

      <li>All procedures related to in-app purchases, refunds and restoration of purchases follow Google Play Billing and Google Play Store policies.</li>
      <li>If fraudulent refunds, unauthorized chargebacks or similar activities are detected, the Company may take reasonable measures such as restricting use of the Service, reclaiming Virtual Currency, or resetting data.</li>
      <li>Whether compensation or refunds will be provided for unused Virtual Currency in the event of Service termination, account suspension, etc. will be determined by comprehensively considering applicable laws, store policies and the Company’s service operation policy.</li>

      <li>any damages resulting from failures, errors or policy changes of third-party services (ads, payments, leaderboards, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the Company is nevertheless held liable by a final court judgment or otherwise, the total liability of the Company, except in cases of the Company’s willful misconduct or gross negligence, shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid by the User to the Company for the Service during the three (3) months immediately preceding the date on which the claim arose, or (ii) KRW 50,000.</p>

      <li>Users may terminate their use of the Service at any time by uninstalling the app. In such cases, unused Virtual Currency and Content will, in principle, not be refunded (unless otherwise required by applicable law or store policies).</li>
      <li>Even after termination of the Service or the User’s use thereof, Articles 11 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 12 (Limitation of Liability) and 17 (Severability and Entire Agreement) shall remain in effect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 14 (Privacy Protection)</h2>
    <p>The Company endeavors to protect Users’ personal data. Details of data processing are set out in the separate <a href="../privacy/en.html">Privacy Policy</a>.

      <li>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea.</li>
      <li>Any dispute between the Company and a User arising out of or in connection with the Service shall first be resolved through good-faith discussions between the parties.
